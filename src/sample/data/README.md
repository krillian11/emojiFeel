# The (Not So Big) Data :sweat_smile:
This is the directory in which our data is stored. If we were Google, or Apple, or Amazon, or Microsoft, we might have billions of data points. Instead, we are a college student with little sleep, and so we have about 46 data points. Even with this "limitation," you'll find that we're able to do a surprisingly large amount. Feel free to peruse the data at will! (This isn't a museum, you are welcome to touch/edit the data)

### Train vs Test :zzz:
Basically, we use the training dataset to try and teach our baby :baby: machine some patterns, and then use the testing one to test its accuracy. Ideally, data in the testing dataset should not have ever been seen before by the machine (i.e. in training). Within each of the folders of this directory, is a folder or *class* with the images belonging to that class inside. If you don't believe me, feel free to go take a look!
